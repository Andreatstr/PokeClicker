# Rate Limiting Configuration
# Increased to 20000 requests per 15 minutes because:
# - All users playing on school/VM network share the same public IP
# - Per-IP rate limiting means all concurrent users count against the same limit
# - With multiple students testing simultaneously, the limit is reached quickly
# - 20000 requests = ~22 requests/second, which accommodates multiple concurrent users
